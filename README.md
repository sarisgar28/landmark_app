This is an web application that creates a user, landmarks(the places you've been or would like to visit), as well as reviews such as comments talking about your experiences on this specific place, is like YELP for landmarks.

Motivation
My motivation is traveling, I love cultures and  getting to know them, is one of the most important things to do in my life, I created this app not just because is my Flatiron School project but I really would like to know everyone else's experiences around the world and telling me about it.

This Web App is created with Ruby on Rails 6.0.3', '>= 6.0.3.4' 

Code style
I am being RESTful 


Installation
I decided to do my installation by using rails generators on my migrations, models, views and controllers.



How to use?

The user can signup by using Google Omniauth or by adding their username, email and password, once you have a login you can access to creating your landmarks, editing them and adding reviews to it.
